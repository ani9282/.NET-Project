            <p>collage information<br /> <br>Government degree colleges in India are public-sector educational institutes managed mainly through rule and regulations of government accompanied by University Grants Commission (India) (UGC). Education in India has been categorized into elementary, secondary and higher education. The aim behind the formation of the government degree colleges is to provide higher education to undergraduates, postgraduates and doctoral research scholars in various streams and courses recognized by UGC[1] of India. Presently, the standards have been set up for the classifications of the institutes in 2 (f) and 12 (b) category, which is certified by the UGC, New Delhi to maintain the excellence in higher education. The government degree colleges are fully managed by government, either central or at state level, and affiliated to the universities for course structures. Moreover, the government degree college as the institute of higher education, are administered and controlled by the principal who serves as the head. Teachers (Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Professor) are appointed through Public Service Commissions (a government body under the articles from 315-323 of the Constitution of India) of central and state governments. The teachers appointed through the public service commissions are government servants with Group A post and are gazetted in nature. Education is the matter of concurrent lists in India; the government from the centre or from the states has the right to formulate law on higher education.</p>
